"G-Day" is a series of large-scale events held by Google in Latin America, Middle East, Africa and India for developers, tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. It started as a part of the G-Africa Initiative that was expanded to Latin America countries in 2012. These events typically lasted for two days, split into the developer day (for developers and technology enthusiasts) and the business day (for entrepreneurs) with the aim of showing them how to leverage Google tools in taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Internet and mobile.
