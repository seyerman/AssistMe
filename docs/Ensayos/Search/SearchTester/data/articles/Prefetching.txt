"Prefetching" in computer science is a technique for speeding up fetch operations by beginning a fetch operation whose result is expected to be needed soon.  Usually this is before it is "known" to be needed, so there is a risk of wasting time by prefetching data that will not be used.  The technique can be applied in several circumstances:

* Cache prefetching, a speedup technique used by computer processors where instructions or data are fetched before they are needed
* Prefetch input queue (PIQ), in computer architecture, pre-loading machine code from memory
* Link prefetching, a web mechanism for prefetching links
* The Prefetcher technology in modern releases of Microsoft Windows
* prefetch instructions, for example provided by
** <code>PREFETCH</code>, an X86 instruction in computing
* Prefetch buffer, a feature of DDR SDRAM memory
* Swap prefetch, in computer operating systems, anticipatory paging
